## 📖 Project Summary
We developed an intelligent platform to make NASA’s **Biological and Physical Sciences Data** easier to search, analyze, and understand.  
Our pipeline fetches and enriches data from PubMed Central (PMC) and NASA APIs, processes it with data analytics and LLM-based summarization, and presents the results in a responsive web interface.  

- **Scientists** get detailed experimental summaries to generate new hypotheses.  
- **Managers** get translational insights highlighting opportunities for innovation and investment.  
- **Mission architects** get safety and efficiency–focused summaries to inform lunar and Martian mission planning.  

This project directly addresses the challenge of **unlocking NASA’s bioscience knowledge base**, making decades of research accessible and useful across different audiences.
